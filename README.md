# CuraAI – Clinical Decision Support System

CuraAI is a simple, browser-based **Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)** prototype designed to demonstrate how technology can assist healthcare professionals during early-stage patient evaluation.

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and focuses on clarity, usability, and responsible design rather than complex backend logic.



 Project Overview

CuraAI allows a user (doctor/clinician) to:
- Enter basic patient details
- Record symptoms
- View simulated diagnostic insights
- See suggested tests and care pathways

The application is intended as a **decision-support tool**, not an automated diagnostic system.



 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Navigation and basic logic  

No frameworks or libraries are used, making the project easy to understand and modify.
